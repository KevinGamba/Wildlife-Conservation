# Project Name: Wild Guard

## Wildlife-Conservation
A blockchain-based platform for wildlife and environmental conservation efforts. Users can donate and track their contributions,
which are used to protect endangered species and preserve natural sites. This platform also offers transparency on how donations are used.

### Problem statement:
Kenya's wildlife, including elephants, rhinos, and coral reefs, face threats from poaching, habitat loss, and climate change.
Conservation efforts often lack transparency and proper tracking for donations and their impact.

### Approach:
A blockchain donation platform that allows tourists, organizations, and citizens to donate directly to wildlife conservation efforts.
Donations are tracked publicly, and conservation efforts are recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

### Vision:
To foster global support for wildlife conservation by making the donation process transparent, ensuring that funds are used for their
intended purpose, and preserving Kenya's heritage.

### Technological Stack:

- Blockchain: Aptos Blockchain for secure, immutable transactions
  
- Frontend: Angular for a dynamic user experience
  
- AI/ML: TensorFlow for donation impact analysis and reporting
  
- Backend: Go with Aptos SDK for high-performance backend services
